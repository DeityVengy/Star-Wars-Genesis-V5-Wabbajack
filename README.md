# Star Wars Genesis V5: Total Conversion Modlist for Starfield
![Starfield Modlist Photoshop Cropped](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star_Wars_Genesis_V2_for_Starfield_1.11.36/assets/170469610/7473f5e6-41f7-44e2-add5-3561df29b1be)

### This is a guide on installing the Star Wars Genesis modlist that converts Starfield into Star Wars, as seen on my YouTube and featured on IGN, Forbes, Dexerto, Kotaku, and countless other forms of media. <br />
### This is not your typical modlist that simply combines every mod out there into a jumbled mess and calls it a day. This is a modlist created by a passionate Star Wars lover and Mod Author that features countless mods of my own that were built specifically for it. <br />
### Star Wars Genesis is an experience. One that you cannot find anywhere else. It is the Ultimate Star Wars RPG, featuring a harsh and unforgiving Galaxy that is not been seen yet in any other form of modern Star Wars media. Heavily inspired off of Star Wars Galaxies, Knights of the Old Republic, and Legends. <br />
### I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you.

#### If you're interested in a more in-depth overview of every mod involved in the list, then take a look at [this](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-Full-Modlist).

## **Requirements:**
- **STEAM** version of Starfield _(No GamePass/Microsoft Support)_. DO NOT ASK FOR MY HELP WITH A PIRATED VERSION
- Version 1.12.30 of Starfield. PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and do NOT ever update until a newer version of Star Wars Genesis releases
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14.40.33810.0](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (Most PC's have this but please make sure)
- Fresh Save (even V4 users) <br /> <br />

## **What is Wabbajack?**<br />
Wabbajack is an automated modlist installer. It will replicate my modlist and all it's configurations with a portable version of Mod Organizer 2 on your PC. If you have premium on Nexus Mods, then this process is very easy and in just a few clicks, you can be downloading hundreds of mods at once. If you don't have premium, it's going to have you click through each mod to download but it'll guide you exactly on which one to click. After that, it'll still do all the load order/plugin configuration for you.


## **IMPORTANT PRE-STEPS**   <br />
- Make sure Starfield is installed in the SAME drive you're installing the modlist on.
- If you have any Creation Store mods, please uninstall ALL of them
- TURN OFF Automatic Updates for Starfield  <br />
  ![image](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-V4-Wabbajack/assets/170469610/4bdeec4d-db5e-4d9e-82a9-e5545dc298f6)
- If you've modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, you ~~probably~~ definitely have lingering mods that will cause problems. Please uninstall Starfield through Steam, double check that both **_Documents\My Games\Starfield_** and **_steamapps\common\Starfield_** folders are deleted, then re-install <br />

### I am not joking. This is NOT Skyrim. Having just 1 mod that's not supposed to be there can make the entire modlist. For those of you who are interested, you find a mini-guide at the end on how to add additional mods to Star Wars Genesis safely.

## **Wabbajack Install Guide**   <br />
1. Create the following three folders at the root of your drive (e.g., C:\, D:\, or whichever drive you're using).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eff384de-f4d1-4f8c-9858-94270f307742)
2. Download [Star Wars Genesis Wabbajack Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/deityvengy) and put it inside the **COMPILER** folder.
3. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.exe from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and put it inside the **WABBAJACK** folder.
4. In the **WABBAJACK** folder, run Wabbajack.exe to install it.
5. After the install finishes, run Wabbajack.exe again to open it.
6. Click the gear icon (settings) on the top left, then logon to Nexus Mods.
7. Go back to the Wabbajack Main Menu and select **Install From Disk**
8. Match everything to this (remember the drive letter like K, C, etc should match yours, not mine):
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78800b97-3041-460a-a389-871179ea2f32)
9. Start the install. if you don't have Nexus Premium, then Wabbajack makes you click through each mod. if you do have Nexus Premium, then Wabbajack downloads each mod automatically for you.
10. Once the install is finished, launch **ModOrganizer.exe** in the **Star Wars Genesis V5** folder. You will get a popup asking about nxm links. Click Yes.

#### Note: ModOrganizer.exe is how you will always start the game from now on. DO NOT just type Mod Organizer in your Windows search bar next time and then accidently open another Mod Organizer 2 install for a different modded game.<br />

## **IMPORTANT POST-STEP** <br />
1. Go to Documents\My Games\Starfield and place the [StarfieldCustom.ini](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sy_oYuMoBkWTvWZTWLl5GE7eNywmoHGA/view?usp=drive_link) file in there <br />
   If you don't see a folder like that, you likely have it on your OneDrive instead. Otherwise, if this is a fresh install of Starfield and you've never played it before, launch the game through Steam atleast once, close it, and try this step again.
## **LAUNCHING THE GAME**
You are now ready to launch the game and complete the last bit of instructions. Make sure _SFSE_ is selected at the top right and click _Run_. <br />
This is how you will always start your game from now on. <br />

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51d62213-409e-49f4-a032-6119e6624c36)
## **IN-GAME SETUP** (DO NOT SKIP THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT)<br />
Now you are ready to launch the game. You may click the RUN button at the top right of Mod Organizer 2 and follow the next few steps.<br />
PLEASE DO NOT PANIC if it takes awhile to start for the first time.

1. After creating your character and loading in for the first time, save your game after the alternate start popup and then fully restart and load that same save to fix the sound issue (and numerous other issues).
2. Your graphics preset most probably reset back to _Low_, which explains why your game is ugly. Go to settings and change it if you wish. My recommended settings are:
   - Motion Blur Off
   - VSync Off
   - Upscaling Off (unless you really need it)
   - Everything else on Ultra (if you can)
   - Show Damage Numbers OFF under Interface
   - Dialogue and General Subtitles ON under Accessibility
3. Music may be off by default for some reason. Highly recommend turning that above "0" so you can hear the amazing soundtrack
3. Make sure your difficulty settings are all on normal.
4. For every new jetpack you equip, you must press F1 to activate the jetpack mod. This will unequip your current jetpack so you will have to equip the jetpack again and then press F1 again
5. Going to mention it one more time here. Disable automatic updates for Starfield on Steam

### Note: If you are for some reason trying to load the modlist into an existing save, then I will not offer further support to you beyond what's in this page [here](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-Existing-Save-Install)



## **HD Overhaul (OPTIONAL)**<br />
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124?tab=files) amounts to 100+ GB of 2-4K textures and will lead to performance issues if you have a weak PC. <br />
MANUALLY DOWNLOAD these files and put the BA2 inside each archive in the steamapps\common\Starfield\Data folder. <br />
- Parts 1 - 15
- Texture Patch <br />
#### Note: DO NOT USE MOD ORGANIZER 2 TO INSTALL THESE OR ELSE YOU WILL HAVE CRASHES AND COUNTLESS BUGS <br />
Your Data folder should have ALL these files in there like this this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a967a16b-3e74-4ac7-a435-6cdbfe07892e) <br />
The final step is to download the Modified Starfield.ini and replace the existing one in your steamapps\common\Starfield directory. You are done.

## Difficulty (Optional)
- If you're finding the game too hard (especially in the beginning), you can increase your health by 50 or 100 with console commands to make it more doable. The command for that is: **_player.modav health 100_**<br />
- If you're finding the game too easy after leveling up and getting proper armor/weapons, you can revert that above change by running this command: **_player.modav health -100_**

## **F.A.Q.**
Technical Support F.A.Q. can be found [here](https://github.com/DeityVengy/Star-Wars-Genesis-FAQ) <br />
The rest are general questions:
### Xbox Version? <br />
   As of V5, this modlist is beyond the mod limit of Starfield and only functions due to thousands of custom patches I've done. That means that is now impossible to replicate without using a modlist auto-installer like Wabbajack, which consoeles don't have. All of my personal mods on Nexus are open permission and free to be ported over by others through. i've noticed some already have been. You can get something similar on Xbox, but not to this level unfortunately, atleast for awhile. 
### How do I get X Weapon/Armor?<br />
   Every single thing in this modlist can be acquired ingame through natural progression. If you want to skip that, then download the Star Wars Genesis Encyclopedia in my Discord and find the base game equivalent of the Weapon/Armor you want. Google the ID of that item and spawn it in with console commands. I DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING IN THE WORKBENCHES. You are free to use stuff in the workbenches but they are not balanced around Star Wars Genesis and may even be buggy.
### Why no lightsabers?<br />
   There are a few lightsaber and Jedi/Sith mods out there but it just doesn't really work or feel immersive, especially with this game's poor melee combat. I will add lightsabers when they are ready with proper animations, deflection, and dismemberment. To be fair, the odds of the average person in Star Wars encountering a Jedi/Sith in this era is pretty low anyway. Just make it part of your headcannon lol.
   
## **Controller Support**

Legal talk aside, I have spent countless hours on this project. I've done my due diligence and gotten permissions from dozens of authors, received licenses from many individuals, and paid hundreds of dollars of my own money to advance the Starfield modding scene.
